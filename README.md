**Vultra Open Source**

Vultra was meant to be an all in one bot which was meant to make your lives much easier but then when attempting to host it on a host a lot of errors appeared, we believe this was because of the v13 d.js Intent update, Because there was a lot of commands to fix and a lot of code to remake we decided to cancel the bot and make it open source so you guys could make good use of the bot, We have recently made 2 new bots using small bots (Aspect & CoinHome). 

**Will you consistantly update this code?**

No because our devs are really busy and we have 2 new bots to work on, Our most experienced developer lost inspiration to code and our second most experienced developer is currently working on his own projects, so unfortunately we can no longer maintain this code. We hope that others will be able to maintain it

**What are the two new bots?**

Aspect - A game and meme bot and CoinHome - A economy bot (both using slash commands) are the two newest bots to discord. Aspect is meant to be a funny, friendly and fun bot that will make your day if your bored/down, Coinhome is meant be fun aswell but in another way. Coinhome is an interactive economy bot while aspect is suppose to be memes/tictactoe/chess ect. Both of their invites are below

**Aspect:** [Here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=846487386095222834&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands)

**Coinhome:** [Here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=896727173136809994&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Rewriting this code to slash commands soon...
